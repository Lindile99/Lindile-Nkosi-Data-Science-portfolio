# 📂 Data Science Portfolio  

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio🚀  
I come from a **Chemistry AND Biochemistry & Cell Biology background** and recently transitioned into data science through a structured **Data Science Bootcamp**.  
My goal is to bridge my science knowledge with data-driven problem solving, applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to real-world projects.  

This repository showcases projects that highlight my ability to analyze data, build models, and communicate insights effectively.
